								<p>Alika is a great student that I met while teaching Spreadsheet and Statistics class in RevoU. He is an intelligent student and active in class, and what I like the most is his dedication when finishing the intermediate and advanced assignments. The logic and calculation are sound, and the visualization is excellent. I believe he will make a superb Data Analyst in any team willing to give him a chance.</p>

								<p>During the short period of time in the course, I would notice that Alika is a curious learner. He would not only dilligently working with the assignment but also going extra miles. I remember when we discuss his Python assignment until midnight and he will only rest when his curiousity is fulfilled. It such a great time while I was a Team Lead of him, and I believe he will become a good Data Analyst in the near future.</p>
